This is Yao Dou!

I am an undregraduate senior at University of Washignton. My current research interests lie in natural language processing (NLP), especially conversational AI and
text generation . My mentor is [Prof. Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/).

I am super fortunate to work with these amazing graduate students: [Maxwell Forbes](https://maxwellforbes.com/), [Ari Holtzman](https://ari-holtzman.github.io/), and [Rik Koncel-Kedziorski](https://rikdz.github.io/).
