This is Yao Dou!

I am a PhD student at Georgia Tech advised by [Prof. Wei Xu](https://cocoxu.github.io/).  My current research interests lie in natural language processing (NLP), especially conversational AI, paraphrase generation, and text evaluation.

I achieved by BS from University of Washington, where my mentor was [Prof. Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/). I was super fortunate to work with these amazing graduate students: [Maxwell Forbes](https://maxwellforbes.com/), [Ari Holtzman](https://ari-holtzman.github.io/), and [Dr. Rik Koncel-Kedziorski](https://rikdz.github.io/).
